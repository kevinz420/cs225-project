# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Team meetings will occur on a weekly basis. These Zoom meetings will last approximately 30 minutes or so in which we will go over our last week's progress as well as any blockers/what we plan on working on this week. Someone will take notes of everyone's feedback so everyone can be accountable for what they have/will do.

2. **Assistance** 
Our text group chat ensure that anyone with a question can have direct access to the rest of our team. Anyone can also private text someone for a specific piece of advice from someone with that skillset. Replies should be within 24 hours to prevent the stop of development.

3. **Respect** 
Every member will be required to present their past and future progress/goals. Other members will comment on each presenters information, ensuring active listening and asking clarifying questions to further understanding.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Work will be modularized into certain sections that members can specialize in. Unforseen work will also be further modularized and delegated to people with a lesser workload. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
Members will be expected to put at least 3 hours/week into their goals. Conflicts are bound to occur and can be settled by creating obtainable, realistic goals especially during weeks when members are extremely busy with tests, projects, etc.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We want to vote on decisions democratically (majority wins) as well as handle individual laziness as a group, without a single person needing to portray himself as the bad guy who targets the individual. It's important to set hard, but reasonable, rules for those who exhibit consistent lack of contribution.
